Peanut butter is calorie-dense and easy to over-consume. Proper measurement is crucial for accurate macro tracking.

## Standard Serving Sizes

## Nutritional Breakdown (per 100g)

- Calories: 588 kcal
- Protein: 25g
- Carbs: 20g
- Fat: 50g

## Common Mistakes

The biggest mistake people make is using a heaping tablespoon instead of a level one. A heaping tablespoon can contain 25-30g instead of 16g - that's almost double the calories!

## How to Measure Accurately

1. Use a digital scale for the most accuracy
2. If using a tablespoon, level it off with a knife
3. Don't estimate - peanut butter is too calorie-dense
4. Track your measurements consistently

## Smart Portioning Tips

- Pre-portion servings into small containers
- Use PB2 powder for fewer calories
- Measure directly on your scale, not on a spoon
- Account for it in your daily fat macros
