One of the most common questions in the fitness community is: "How many grams is one scoop of protein powder?" The answer isn't as straightforward as you might think.

## Why Scoop Sizes Vary

Different protein powder brands use different scoop sizes. A "scoop" typically ranges from 25g to 40g, depending on the manufacturer. This can significantly affect your macro calculations if you're not measuring carefully.

## Common Scoop Sizes by Brand

- **Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard:** 30g per scoop
- **Dymatize ISO100:** 32g per scoop
- **MyProtein Impact Whey:** 25g per scoop
- **MuscleTech NitroTech:** 44g per scoop

## How to Measure Accurately

The most accurate way to measure protein powder is to use a digital kitchen scale. Here's how:

1. Place your shaker or bowl on the scale and zero it out (tare)
2. Add your protein powder until you reach your desired weight
3. Use our converter tool to calculate the exact macros

## Example Calculations

Let's say you want to consume 25g of protein. If your protein powder contains 80g of protein per 100g:

**Formula:** (25g protein ÷ 80g) × 100g = 31.25g of powder needed

## Pro Tips

- Always check the nutrition label for the exact scoop weight
- Use a digital scale for the most accurate measurements
- Don't rely on the scoop that comes with your protein powder - they can vary
- Calculate macros based on weight, not volume
