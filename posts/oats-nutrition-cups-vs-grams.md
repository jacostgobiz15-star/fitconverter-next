Measuring oats in cups can lead to significant inaccuracies in your macro tracking. Here's why weighing is better.

## The Problem with Cup Measurements

One cup of oats can vary anywhere from 80g to 100g depending on how densely packed they are. This 20g difference can mean an extra 75 calories you didn't account for.

## Standard Measurements

- **1 cup of rolled oats:** approximately 90g
- **1/2 cup of rolled oats:** approximately 45g
- **1/4 cup of rolled oats:** approximately 22.5g

## Nutritional Breakdown (per 100g dry oats)

- Calories: 379 kcal
- Protein: 13g
- Carbs: 67g
- Fat: 7g
- Fiber: 10.6g

## Why It Matters

If you're tracking macros for specific goals (cutting, bulking, or maintaining), these small differences add up. Over a week, inconsistent oat measurements could mean 500+ extra calories you didn't plan for.
